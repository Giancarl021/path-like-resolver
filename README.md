# Path-Like Resolver

Generate tree structure from a list of UNIX-like paths, with support for custom payloads.

## Why?

This package allows simple transformations on path lists to a tree structure, which can be used in a file explorer, for example. The package is very simple and lightweight, and it's written in TypeScript, allowing generics for payloads or no payloads at all.
